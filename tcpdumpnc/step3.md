## use both tcpdump and nc together



ts isp connections

ping  checking the timeouts for
    local gw
    8.8.8.8

    tracert 8.8.8.8

    check router for its, ISP ip and gw
    try pinging those 2 see timeout
    try pinging with '-l'  allows your to set size (what about fragmenst)

hopefully the tracert will return an ASN number
lookit up  - give websites
Try connecting to looking glass server and back tracert
try a speed test - give websites
ping while running speed test (to local asn router)


report to your isp,  request a 'line test'
