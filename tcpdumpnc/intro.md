## (in progress)

In this scenario we will learn to use tcpdump and netcat (nc) on an ubuntu linux server

offical sites
(tcpdump.org)[https://www.tcpdump.org/]
(netcat)[http://netcat.sourceforge.net/]
(wireshark)[]

general list of network admin tools
(netadmintools.com)[https://www.netadmintools.com/]


can we add a step 4 for analysis of files/streams - perhaps with elasticstack   or wireshark
and what about the windows version?
