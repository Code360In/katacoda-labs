# over view of dag graphs

there are no cycles in dag graphs

image of dag graph (inc one with simple math, and the equation that it is doing)

How are cyclic operations done in DAG's. Called 'unrolling', you generate a new graph and feed the op of one into the other

In TensorBoard you can see the shape and result of your dag


show a large dag graph and how is cut up for distribution across nodes

Tensors,  an array of inforation

# 2 phases

there are two phases at generating a ml graph

1) build : build the components of your graph

2) run : run your graph
