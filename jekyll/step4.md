### Themes
When you generate a new site with 'jekyll new <site>' a theme for the website will be used, ie minia.
This is defined in the _config.yaml file.
To find a new theme head over to [rubygems.org](ruby gems)  and search for 'jekyll-theme'. You may want to review the github page for that gem/theme.
When you've decided on a theme, add the gem to the gemfile in the same format as minina (you can keep minina). Not that themes include layouts, so you'll have to take that into consideration if you already have a set of layouts.
Stop serving the website, and run
`bundle install`
Replace the theme name in the _config.yaml file
run `bundle exec jekyll serve` (1st time only).
Reload the webpage and test, see if there are any errors being generated by the server.
Sometimes you'll see layout missing errors, chech the themes github/page to see what layouts it allows.
