# A basic intro to setting up Jekyll

Jekyll is a static website generator(SSG), that works with html, css, and javascript without having to deal with a complex CMS or server side processing. It uses Ruby as it's underlying system.

In this scenario we'll install the needed components on a Ubuntu Linux server and have Jekyll generate the html files for us and use Jekyll's built in server feature to serve out the content.

If a ruby based SSG isn't for you, checkout [staticgen.com](https://www.staticgen.com/) for a list of SSG's.


Most of this scenario is generated from jekyll's website step-by-step tutorial.
